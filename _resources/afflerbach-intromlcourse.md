## Overview
This curriculum provides students an introduction to using machine learning tools and the associated necessary background on machine learning methods and statistical analysis. Throughout the curriculum, students will work thorugh hands-on example to generate and assess machine learning models. They will learn key ideas for assessing model performance and decision making skills for how to improve or modify a model.

It is expected that between synchronous (and asynchronous) meetings, work groups, and completion of activities that students will spend ~9 hours of time on work related to their participation in the Skunkworks Education group each week. This corresponds to approximately a 3 credit hour course if receiving credit for an independent study course.
