# {Data Science in Materials}
* * *

## Type of Content
* Full Course
* Slides, Jupyter Notebooks
* This course is in modules. The key information of what is in each module can be found in /Admin/Module Tasks HW List_v2 (links may need to be updated).  Each module has a folder for HW, slides, and labs in /Modules. There were quizzes but those are in Canvas so I cannot share them easily.  Fee free to email me for more details.  Easy use cases are to grab a whole module for your class, or grab a one or more of a notebook or slides from a modules to help in prep for a topic. 

## Learning Objectives
* Recall and utilize basic principles and methods of how informatics (data science and machine learning) can be used in materials science and engineering	Both Grad & Undergrad
* Apply software tools related to materials informatics	Both Grad & Undergrad
* Communicate effectively about technical work in oral and written presentation	Both Grad & Undergrad
* Develop machine learning workflows for informatics applications in materials science and engineering

## Introduction
Introduction to applications of data science in materials science and engineering, including understanding the creation and use of modern data resources, data-centric approaches to materials, and the integration of machine learning across the materials landscape.
