## Overview
This is a 1-2 hour group activity developed for the Fall 2024 Informatics Skunkworks All-Hands meeting. It is meant to be completed in small groups as has the premise of demonstrating and challenging participants to rapidly develop and iterate on a machine learning training workflow using AI coding assisstants. The activity will hopefully demonstrate to students how these tools can enable them to rapidly explore ideas for training models.  

## Learning Objectives
- Students are able to code using AI assisstance
- Students explain the key steps and choices made to create an ML workflow
  
## Additional Information
The provided template notebook hooks up to an existing kaggle challenge (won't be active anymore), but a new challenge can easily be created from the previous one as a template. The kaggle framework works nicely as a live leaderboard to track all group's progress.
