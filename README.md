# DSM-CORE
Data Science for Materials - a Collection of Open Resources for Education

# Goals
1. Easy maintenance. Information provided here should be a general overview to give users an idea of what is the content, it's scope, and structure
2. Everything should link out to where it is being maintained elsewhere with a permanent link. Periodically we will check for stale links and reach out for an update.

# Contribute
1. Download the [Template](https://github.com/bafflerbach/DSM-CORE/blob/main/template-resource.md)
3. Fill in the main sections (Everything with UPDATE) of the template with links to and a brief description of the materials being shared. Note that this is ideally a persistant link that will automatically include any future updates to materials
4. Save the file be: yourlastname-shortitle.md
5. Create a Fork of the repo
6. Navigate to the _resources directory in your new fork and select "Add File" -> "Upload Files" and upload your ".md" file
7. Commit your upload
8. Your repo should now say "1 commit ahead...", select "Contribute" -> "Open Pull Request". This should be auto accepted if everything suceeded.
9. Confirm that your new resource is showing up as desired on the [webpage] (https://bafflerbach.github.io/DSM-CORE/)
10. If you need to make any edits you can repeat from step 7 except instead of uploading you can edit your file directly via the webpage if you prefer.
